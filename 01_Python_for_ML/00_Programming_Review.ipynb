        "**Notebook Summary:** In this notebook, we will go over the basics of Python programming so that everyone has the necessary tools for the rest of the semester. These topics may either be entirely new to you, something that you're very familiar, or somewhere in-between. This is expected and perfectly okay given the many different academic disciplines you all come from. I will provide additional resources for any students that would appreciate more clarification on coding after going through this notebook. Do not hesistate to reach out if any of these topics are not clear and make sure to take advantage of office hours to discuss any questions that arise.\n",

        "**Learning a Programming Language Takes Time**: It is important to remember that you cannot learn an entire programming language from one notebook. The goal of this notebook is to serve as an introduction. The best way to learn a new programming language is through experience. You often times will not know the exact function that you want or the best package to achieve your goal. This is something that still happens to me and I've been using Python for 5+ years now. That is okay! When you come across a time that you don't know which function to use or the exact syntax, you can look search on Google and find others who had the same questions you had (e.g. looking on Stack Overflow). **The most important part is that you know what you want to achieve and why, more so than exactly how to do it.** Progrmaming languages come and go, but the processes do not.\n",

        "\n",
        "* The reason to use Python is that it is **efficient for you**, not that it is a high performance language\n",
        "* Instead of thinking just about hardware/software and run time, if you take developer time and suffering into account, Python becomes an efficient language in big picture terms\n",
        "* It is undeniable, however, that Python does not compare favorably to languages like C/C++ or Rust in terms of speed\n",
        "* Python is not an \"efficient\" language for at least a few reasons:\n",
        "  1. It is interpreted, so all of the code is compiled (converted from human-readable to machine-readable) as the IPython interpreter reads your work line by line. This replicates lots of work and isn't globally optimized, slowing everything down.\n",
        "  1. Python has a Global Interpreter Lock, so only one set of instructions (thread) can be processed at a time. This makes it hard to take advantage of your multiple CPU cores and GPU(s).\n",
        "  1. The packages you're using are often not that efficient themselves: Unless they're calling compiled C, FORTRAN, or Rust code for use with Python, the above problems get compounded (e.g. Pandas is built on NumPy, Polars is an API to Rust code)\n",
        "* If there are problems, this is how you escalate:\n",
        "  * Substitute vectorization and map when possible rather than using for loops. Passing arguments as vectors to, for example, NumPy will vastly speed things up\n",
        "  * Use packages that call efficient code written in low-level languages (e.g. Pandas is build on Numpy, but Polars is built in Rust).\n",
        "  * Use Numba's just-in-time compilation tools to convert your interpreted Python code to compiled Python code.\n",
        "  * Use multiprocessing/multithreading. In Python, these packages are kind of a hassle.\n",
        "* Write the slow code in C/C++ or FORTRAN or Rust, and call it from Python. These languages don't have the GIL and aren't interpreted, so doing this solves most of your problems."
