### Course Overview

Welcome to DS 3001: Foundations of Machine Learning! This course is designed to introduce students to the foundational knowledge in each of the four high level domain areas of data science (Value, Design, Analytics, Systems). This includes an emphasis on ethical issues surrounding the field of data science and how these issues originate and extend into society more broadly. Students will learn to work with data sets, create and evaluate foundational predictive models, and further fine-tune these models to improve performance. A particular focus of the class is on the "why" rather than the "how" for each step in the machine learning pipeline. This focus will allow students to transfer what they learn in this class to new programming languages and algorithms that they encounter throughout their career.
